## Overview

Educational-tree-GUI is a master thesis project which purpose is:

> The purpose of the thesis is to implement an **interactive GUI, capable of showing an animated presentation** of a
> given operations:
> 1. insertion,
> 2. deletion,
> 3. search,
> 4. finding minimum and maximum values,
> 5. counting mean and median
>
> in:
> 1. ASA-graphs,
> 2. AVB+trees,
> 3. AVB-trees,
> 4. AVL trees,
> 5. red-black trees,
> 6. B+trees,
> 7. and B-trees
>
> to educationally present how these operations work, including intermediate steps. The scope of the thesis includes
> implementing the structures with a unified GUI, **with the possibility of observing operations and comparing them for
two selected trees**.

In addition to the above-mentioned functionalities, the app can also:

1. increase/decrease the size of the drawn nodes,
2. change the speed of the animation,
3. browse the previous states of the structure
